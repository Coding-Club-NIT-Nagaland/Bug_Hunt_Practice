# Question 6: Reverse an Array (In-Place)

## Problem Statement

Write a function that reverses an array **"in-place"**. This means you should modify the original array directly by swapping elements, without creating a new array.

## Example

* `arr` = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
* **Expected Output (array is modified to):** {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}

* `arr` = {10, 20, 30, 40}
* **Expected Output (array is modified to):** {40, 30, 20, 10}

The buggy code runs, but the array looks... unchanged. Find the bug!
