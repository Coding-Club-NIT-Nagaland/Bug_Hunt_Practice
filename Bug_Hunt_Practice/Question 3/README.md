# Question 3: Palindrome Checker

## Problem Statement

A **palindrome** is a word that reads the same backward as forwards (e.g., "racecar", "madam").

Write a function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. It should return `true` if it is, and `false` if it is not. The check should be case-sensitive ("Racecar" is *not* a palindrome).

## Example

* `text` = "racecar"
* **Expected Output:** `true` (or `1`)

* `text` = "hello"
* **Expected Output:** `false` (or `0`)
