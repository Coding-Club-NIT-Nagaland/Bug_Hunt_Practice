# Question 4: Average Calculator

## Problem Statement

Write a function that calculates the average value of an array of integers. The average can be a decimal, so the return type should be a floating-point number (e.g., `double` or `float`).

## Example

* `grades` = {100, 90}
* **Expected Output:** `95.0`

* `grades` = {5, 10, 2}
* **Expected Output:** `5.666...`
