# üêû Bug Hunt: First-Year Challenge

Welcome to the First-Year Bug Hunt! This repository contains a set of coding challenges designed for new programmers.

## The Challenge

Each folder (`Question_01` to `Question_10`) contains a programming problem. Your goal is **not** to solve the problem from scratch, but to **find the logical bug** in the provided code.

## Rules
1.  **No Syntax Errors:** All the code provided will compile or run without syntax errors.
2.  **No Runtime Errors:** The code will not crash, throw an exception, or access invalid memory (under normal test conditions).
3.  **Logical Errors Only:** The code runs, but it produces the **wrong answer**. Your job is to find the line(s) of code that *look* correct but contain a logical flaw.
4.  **Check All Languages:** The *same logical bug* exists in the C, C++, and Python versions of the code. Understanding the problem in one language will help you find it in the others.

## How to Participate
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to a question folder (e.g., `cd Question_01`).
3.  Read the `README.md` file in that folder to understand what the program is *supposed* to do.
4.  Examine the `buggy.c`, `buggy.cpp`, or `buggy.py` file.
5.  Compile and run the code. See what it outputs.
6.  Compare the output to the expected output in the `README.md`.
7.  Identify the logical error and write down the corrected line of code.

Good luck, and happy bug hunting!
